Several add-ons are available as zip files in the mailpress folder.
They are in fact WordPress plugins interacting with MailPress.
The basic idea is to keep the core of MailPress as stable as possible
and to use the WordPress API to propose some add ons, 
making MailPress completely scalable to your needs.
